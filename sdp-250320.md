## Typesafe State Machines in Rust
 - Hello my name is Viking Edstr√∂m 
 - I am new to Agreat, but I have enjoyed my time here so far!
 - Today, we are going to talk about a technique for building state machines in Rust that prevents a lot of common errors
 - Don't worry if you have not used Rust before, I will explain everything as we go

### 10000-feet overview of Rust
 - Who here have heard of Rust? Who has written Rust?
 - Systems programming language with a focus on memory safety, a major source of security bugs
 - Modern ecosystem through Cargo, which is a build system, package manager, and much more
 - Powerful zero-cost abstractions enable fearless concurrency, even at very complex scales
 - The compiler is very strict
   - Memory safety is achieved through ownership of data, and a borrow checker that ensures references do not live longer than intended
   - Mutability is never implied, all mutable variables have to be declared with the `mut` keyword
   - Much like functional languages like Haskell, code that compiles is always safe, and often correct
 - I will also highlight some of the nicer features of Rust in the code, which will be available afterwards

#### The Borrow Checker
 - Underpins much of what we are going to look at today
 - For this talk, there are three different type of variables we need to know
 - Owned: `Thing`
   - We have singular control of this data, and we can create new references to it
   - While we own this data, no other part of the program can own it at the same time
   - We can only move this if there are no outstanding references to it
 - References: `&Thing`
   - We can only read from this reference, and can only create other read-only references
   - Multiple references can exist to the same data at the same time
   - Very common as a method receivers and arguments to functions
 - Mutable references: `&mut Thing`
   - We can read and write to this data
   - Also called an "exclusive borrow", as no other references can exist while we have this
   - Most common as a receiver (`self`) to methods
 - There is some automatic coercion between types, but only when it is 100% safe to do so
   - For example, we can pass a `&mut Thing` when a `&Thing` is expected

### Code priorities
 - Whenever we write code, there are several aspects of the result that must be balanced
   - The most important is the correctness of the code
     - I don't think this is controversial
     - Without correctness, nothing else matters
     - A sub-corollary of this is that we prefer compiletime errors to runtime errors
   - Next is readability, which includes editability
     - Is the code easy to extend, both by you and other people?
     - Most code is edited many times over its lifespan
   - Last is performance
     - We obviously cannot sacrifice correctness for performance
     - In a large majority of circumstances, you should not sacrifice readability for performance either
       - If we do, it is after careful measuring

### State Machines
 - State machines are a powerful concept for encoding real-world systems
 - Many systems are built on top of a state machine, or can be easily modelled as such
   - Network connections
   - Regular expressions
   - Messages/order systems
   - Turn based games
   - Traffic lights
   - Scene management in games

### Our State Machine
 - Toy model of a rocket launch
   - Could be extended with many more states (like re-entry), but that is not the point
 - Very important that the actions are only carried out in the correct state
   - For example, we really only want to be able to start the engines when we are on the ground
   - Other actions are more permissive, we can always hail the spacecraft on the radio

### Time for code!
 - Feel free to interupt with questions!

### A Naive Implementation
 - Naive implementations often have runtime overhead or are easy to misuse
 - State is stored as an enum value
   - Another nice feature of Rust are data fields on enum variants
 - Each function must check its preconditions, and panic at runtime if they are not met
   - We could use Result or Option here, but that is not the point of this example
   - Easy to miss preconditions, and `&mut` everywhere
 - Can anyone see the bug in the `dock()` function?
   - We do not check the state of the other Spacecraft
 - Can anyone see the bug in the `undock()` function?
   - We overwrite the state first, even if the state was not correct!

### Rust to the Rescue
 - It would be nice if we could let the compiler take care of it!
   - Preferrably with minimal runtime overhead, both in what code we execute and the memory we use
 - Encode the state as a type parameter instead
   - The states are no longer values, but are instead types
     - This lets us move the logic from the runtime to the compiler
   - We store the state to enable state-specific data
     - Most state structs are 0-sized and they will be completely erased at runtime
     - If all states were 0-sized, one could use a `PhantomData`
   - State transition functions consume the previous binding and create a new instance
     - This can be made to be pretty cheap with clever data layout - but remember the priorities!
     - The borrow checker ensures we can never use the previous bindings
 - Rust allows specialized `impl`-blocks for different type parameters, grouping related code together
   - It is no longer possible to call a function on a different state, checked at runtime
   - This is also understood by IDEs, which doesn't even suggest invalid functions
   - Functions can be applied to more than one state via marker traits (`CanPerformScience`)

### Limitations and workarounds:
 - Slightly more code, but it is a linear overhead that would disappear with longer method bodies
   - In future Rust versions, const generics may enable us to use an `enum` instead of separate structs for the state
 - Can be cumbersome to do undeterministic state transitions
 - No shared references to the state machine, due to state transitions requiring ownership
   - This also means you cannot store a list of all spacecraft, due to them being different types
 - The executable becomes slightly bigger, as each specialization is generated and optimized independently

### Advanced concepts:
 - So where do we go from here?
 - The example is written with synchronous code, but the concept can be applied in async contexts as well
 - Also possible to have multiple orthogonal states, enabling even more complicated machines to be modeled
   - However, this makes the code considerably more complicated to write
   - Would not use more than two state type parameters
 - This is essentially compile-time dependency injection, but with state

### Thank you
 - There is a lot of talk about how hard Rust is, and while the learning curve is steeper than say Python, there is a lot of good material out there
   - If you want to learn Rust, the interactive version of the Rust book is awesome
     - It has interactive quizzes that really helps with learning the material
   - I also want to highlight Jon Gjengset, whose Youtube channel has some of the best intermediate level Rust content on the internet
 - The code, notes, and presentation for this talk is also available on my GitHub, if anyone wants to take a closer look
